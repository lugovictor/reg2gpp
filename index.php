<h1>Reg2GPP</h1>
<h2>Registry to Group Policy Preferences XML Converter Version 0.7.3 Beta</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The purpose of this tool is to convert Windows registry files (*.reg) into a format usable by Group Policy Preferences (*.xml), which is used in Windows Active Directory environments to propagate settings across to multiple Windows-based computers (usually in a corporate environment). Apparently, Microsoft didn't feel it necessary to create an official way to do this, and the task of manually importing each registry setting from one system to the other can become extremely tedious, time-consuming, and prone to error. Reg2GPP was designed as the bridge between these two systems, saving potentially hours of work.</p>
<p><strong>TO USE:</strong> Choose the .reg file you want to convert and hit Upload. The next page will verify it uploaded successfully, and give you a couple of options. When happy, click Convert and Download XML and you should get a prompt to download your XML file.</p>
<p><strong>TO APPLY:</strong> Copy the file to your clipboard (just find the file, and either right-click -> "Copy" or select it and Ctrl+C). In Group Policy Management Editor, under Computer/User Configuration -> Preferences -> Windows Settings -> Registry, right click anywhere in whitespace and click "Paste". The settings SHOULD then be imported directly as collections of Registry settings. Hopefully.</p>
<p>I am not responsible for your domain network or any of the computers on said network spontaneously losing data, crashing, spontaneously combusting, being confiscated by Microsoft footsoldiers or otherwise becoming unusable, inaccessible, or explody.</p>
<p>If you're messing with this sort of stuff, I expect you to know what you're doing. Don't blame me if it breaks. On the plus side, this online tool is and always will be 100% free (as in freedom, and as in beer).</p>

<h3>Supporting Reg2GPP</h3>
<p>Reg2GPP is free to everyone and always will be. However, some of you out there who have used Reg2GPP and wanted to show your thanks have asked for a donate button to show your support financially (thank you for your kind words!). Unfortunately, Australian law apparently requires PayPal to restrict the use of their Donate button to registered not-for-profits. So instead, I have added a "Buy Now" button, and instead of sending me a donation, you can literally "buy me a beer". Each "beer" is AUD$1 (they're not very good beers), and you're free to buy as many as you would like in support for Reg2GPP :).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is totally optional. I'm not begging for support, or slowly building a paywall, this is entirely an exercise for those of you out there who have felt Reg2GPP has been such a great benefit for you that you would like to send a small token of thanks.</p>

<p>This tool is Beta quality. If it's not generating your file correctly, please contact me at <?php echo hide_email(WEBMASTER_EMAIL) ?> with a copy of the registry file you're trying to convert and hopefully I can find the problem and fix it as soon as possible.</p>
